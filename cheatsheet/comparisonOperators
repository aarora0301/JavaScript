There are many Comparison Operators in JavaScript. All of these operators return a boolean true or false value.
The most basic operator is the equality operator ==. The equality operator compares two values and returns true if they're equivalent or false 
if they are not. Note that equality is different from assignment (=), which assigns the value at the right of the operator to a variable in the left.

Note: In order for JavaScript to compare two different data types (for example, numbers and strings), it must convert one type to another.
 This is known as "Type Coercion". Once it does, however, it can compare terms as follows:

1 == 1 // true
1 == 2 // false
1 == '1' // true
"3" == 3 // true


Strict equality (===) is the counterpart to the equality operator (==). However, unlike the equality operator, which attempts to convert 
both values being compared to a common type, the strict equality operator does not perform a type conversion.

If the values being compared have different types, they are considered unequal, and the strict equality operator will return false.

3 === 3 // true
3 === '3' // false


The inequality operator (!=) is the opposite of the equality operator. It means "Not Equal" and returns false where equality would return true
and vice versa. Like the equality operator, the inequality operator will convert data types of values while comparing.
1 != 2 // true
1 != "1" // false
1 != '1' // false
1 != true // false
0 != false // false


The strict inequality operator (!==) is the logical opposite of the strict equality operator. It means "Strictly Not Equal" and returns false
 where strict equality would return true and vice versa. Strict inequality will not convert data types.

3 !== 3 // false
3 !== '3' // true
4 !== 3 // true

Comparison with the Greater Than Operator/Comparison with the Less Than Operator:
Like the equality operator, greater than operator will convert data types of values while comparing.
5 > 3 // true
7 > '3' // true
2 > 3 // false
'1' > 9 // false

2 < 5 // true
'3' < 7 // true
5 < 5 // false
3 < 2 // false
'8' < 4 // false

Comparison with the Greater Than Or Equal To Operator/Comparison with the Less Than Or Equal To Operator:
Like the equality operator, greater than or equal to operator will convert data types while comparing.
6 >= 6 // true
7 >= '3' // true
2 >= 3 // false

4 <= 5 // true
'7' <= 7 // true
5 <= 5 // true
3 <= 2 // false
'8' <= 4 // false

'7' >= 9 // false
